Welcome to the Sub Sum Problem Game!

In this game, you will be tasked with adding items randomly given to you into a bag. These items have a
particular value to them as well as a weight value. Your goal is to load as many items as you can into the bag
before it fills up. If the total value of your items outweighs that of your opponent, you win! You will be given the
choice to select RandomBot or GreedyBot as your opponent. RandomBot will randomly select an available item of theirs
into the bag, regardless of thought to how much it weighs or how valuable it is. GreedyBot will ALWAYS try to add the
highest value item to the bag. See if you can challenge both bots and beat them!
